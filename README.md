Displays a nice welcome page for people who want to know more about some online information, redirecting to another page from a page button. The source was made in [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). We used the [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) version of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), designed to be usable and allowing to describe more precisely the content. On the same time, we used [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3) since it brings a lot of long-awaited novelteies, like transitions and annimations, both important to our page button. Finally, we used [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) as the programming language of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/). The source is based on the [Welcome](https://codepen.io/nakome/pen/AELuF) repository of [Moncho Varela](https://codepen.io/nakome/) from the [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) platform.

## Instructions

This repository contains the source material for a **welcoming** page. The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory. Starting with the [`index.html`](src/index.html) file, it is here where we call both [`css/`](src/css/) and [`js/`](src/js/) sources. The [`css/`](src/css/) source is a style sheet file to programmatically configure the set of transitions and annimations of the **welcoming** page. On the other hand, the [`js/`](src/js/) is where are the [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) files, and therefore the scripting instructions.
